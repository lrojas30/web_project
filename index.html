	<h6>Leorenny Rojas: Born and raised in Venezuela, living in the United States, Immigration paralegal by profession over five years, and a current student at Valencia College pursuing an Associate in Science degree with a major in Mobile Journalism. My background in immigration and legal support has shaped my passion for storytelling and advocacy, and I am now combining that experience with hands-on training in multimedia reporting to amplify underrepresented voices and bring impactful stories to the public.</h6>
